# ECONOMICS

# GOALS:
* "The largest difference with most existing solutions in the space is that we don't intend to build a monolithic chain, but rather provide this as a tool for individual communities and substrate chains to build their own "storage communities"
* MAYBE REPLACE: `"distributed file storage"` WITH: `"would enable access to large file storage on substrate"`

# OPTIMISTIC ASSUMPTIONS
if users love the service and we make sharing free disk space opt-out,
there might be enough disk space available
also everyone starts earning "ratio"
maybe we should have a seperate brainstorming sessions about
* no, i mean, what you say makes sense :-)
  * i'm curious how all of this will turn out and if the opt-out behavior
  * of the app will help to make things work well
  * (hopefully ppl earn enough ratio automatically so it always works.

# DASHBOARD
the UX of the electron app and
how exactly users can influence settings and
how the dashboard will show them information so they can adjust
...or basically understand whats happening on the marketplace
and how ratio is behaving, etc...

# MODE: HOSTER (=commercial)
...

# MODE: SEEDER (=friends)
...

# MODE: COMMUNAL
1. like, as a network grows "free use" becomes more and more unreliable,
2. and "reliable use" becomes more and more expensive (or time/resource heavy)
3. and maybe interconnectivity, and discovery of those connections,
4. would help solve that - by letting seeders discover where their space would
5. give them the most value
6. seeders - where spacetime would give most value
7. pinnerd/users - lower barrier to entry, which instance would give the
8. most reliability where they care


# VOTING/PRICING
there is one "voting" slide with open questions about economics and pricing
about options/choices of users regarding "ratio" (or whatever we call the token)
* things can become collude-y/monopolyish if answered wrongly
  * because all new users will have the lowest possible ratio,
  * and if that isn't the case we have a sybil problem again
* connections between datdot instances could be a solution for this? ðŸ¤” voluntary connections?


# FREE EXTRINSICS
if submitting extrinsics costs nothing
and we can anyway check for the validity of extrinsics,
then all that could happen is that somebody spams
the chain with those but we ignore them
...still they could register as seeder and then unregister as seeder,
thats valid and they could spam the network with those
kind of transactions - which they can't if transactions
cost.
