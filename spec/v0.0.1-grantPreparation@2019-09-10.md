# GRANT

## Filecoin for Dat protocol

- **community engagement grants** (3-10k)
    - topics
        - workshops, hackathons, meetups...
- **technical grants** 
    - (up to 30k, if 30-100k - longer time to decide about the grant, teams shouldn't seek for 100% covering of their costs)
    - topics
        - Protocol integrations 
            - bridges (RFP)
            - distributed file storage
        - Documentation/tutorials
        - ...
    - Bridges (RFP) - bitcoin, ethereum, zcash, other blockchains
        - **Requirements:** The following requirements are for a bridge design that only supports trustless token transfers from the external blockchain to Polkadot and also provides the ability for those assets to be transferred back from Polkadot to the external blockchain. This is the minimum functionality required in any bridge design 
        - **Deliverables:** (specs, implementation or both)
        For the specification, the chosen team will produce the following:
            - A description of the functionality and requirements of their bridge design.
            - A full written specification of the bridge design. The specification should be detailed enough such that a competent team could implement the bridge.
            - A security analysis to explain how the specification corresponds to the stated requirements.

            For the implementation, the chosen team will team will produce the following:

            - A fully working software implementation of the bridge specification
            Our acceptance tests should mostly consist of sending messages and/or value through the bridge while preserving trust model constraints.
            - Complete documentation
            A demonstration that security was considered throughout the entire project lifecycle and evidence that the implementation has no known security flaws.
            - Software should be licensed using Apache 2.0 (preferred) or the MIT license. We will consider licensing arrangements upon request

            - It is expected that the chosen team(s) work closely with the W3F during both the writing of the specification and the implementation.

- roadmap
    - up to 3 months
    - 1 month = 1 milestone
    - template:

        >**Milestone 1 — Implement Substrate Modules — 1 month — $10,000**
        We will create a Substrate module that will:
          * `@TODO:` list the functions that will be coded for the first milestone.
        We will deliver a working module, along with a simple tutorial that explains how a user can spin up one of our Substrate nodes. Once the node is up, it will be possible to send test transactions that will show how the new functionality works.

        >**Milestone 2 — Additional features — 1 month — $10,000**
        Describe the next round of features and functions that will be added.
        Explain how you will demonstrate that the functionality you built will work as intended.

        >**Milestone 3 — Additional features — 1 month — $10,000**
        Describe the last round of features and functions that will be added.
        Explain how you will demonstrate that the thing you functionality will work as intended.


- Please include documentation (for example tutorials) in your milestones.
- Indicate if you accept partial payment in DOTs.
- We recommend providing a docker container for the delivery of your project. This removes the need to install specific dependencies on a per-project basis which can cause delays in having milestones assessed.
