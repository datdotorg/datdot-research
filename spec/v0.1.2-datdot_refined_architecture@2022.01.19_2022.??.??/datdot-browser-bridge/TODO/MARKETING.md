The precarious Web
walled gardens, facebook you-are-now-leaving-the-facebook-sector warnings, free basics

many kinds of fragmentation on many layers [slate], we'll discuss specific kinds

content that falls off the internet (domain owner change, link structure change, acquisition, censorship)

content that has copies in many locations, which are all hidden in favor of the original address

lack of content integrity

lack of a concept of changing content. it changes regardless.

ownership

location-addressing gives control over data to those entities who already have enough resources for server + bandwidth + domain + certificates
control its liveness through hosting it (whether it's allowed to continue to exist and be available)
and through not being able to address replicated copies in the network
control its truth, by controlling the request path
location-addressing ties linked content to only to one entity, but also to exactly one transport mechanism
this is part of the addressing rift
huge liability of not being able to upgrade and mix transports
history of the url shows you have only very small window (~2yrs) for fundamental changes
