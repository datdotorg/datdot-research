## predictions / assumptions
1. MULTI CHAIN WORLD - many teams build chains
2. Decentralised crypto-economic systems will become the new states of the internet world

# Decentralised Crypto-Economic System
* Decentralised crypto-economic systems are ecnomically powerful entities
* `Evolvability` is paramount to long-term viability
* `Governance` is critical to ensure valuable evolution will continue indefinitely
  * `Governance` is critical for managing outward relations
  * `Governance` is critical for putting those resources to work in the best interests of the system
* => Cohesive governance will wake blockchains from their comatose state

## Governance in Context of crypto-economic system
* `Decisions` fall typically only to the evolution of the protocol
* `Rules` are algorithmic, absolute and machine-executable
* `Accountability` is facilitaded thgouth machine-readable signed statements and transactions


# GOVERNANCE
* Facilitates evolution
* puts economic resources to use
* shapes external relations
  * e.g. polkadot relay-chain
  * governance can upgrade code to become part of polkadaot or not

Implemented in a non-algorithmic manner,
it is vague, opaque and exclusive
Leads to slow decision making, deadlock
* Because good change !== popular change
* and bad change != contentious change


**Autonomous Governance**
* same reasons we want autonomous (smart) contracts
Machines are impartial, efficient, fast, rule-followers.
Decentralisation and crypto prevent corruption.
We should use them. Obviously

1. `rules`
  * rules over the system rather than within the system
2. `adopting decisions`
  * around standards / protocols
3. `accountability` => measure impact
4. `regulation` => improve rules


# Metaprotocol Model

## Traditional: e.g. Bitcoin
* Protocol -> "Nebulous Crowd of Indecision"
 * Fork1
 * Fork2
 * Fork3
 * Fork4

 BITCOIN is a dumb actor and can't make that kind of governance decision

No requirements of formal rules
No means to guarantee process and rules are respected
No means to ensure accountability/transparency
Leads to vague & dumb processes, personality-driven decision-making
Risk of stagnancy, fragmentation and "silent coup d'etats"

## Metaprotocol: e.g. Polkadot
Risk of volatility & collapse if rules are wrong
* => Can always "fall back" onto traditional model in dire straits


* Meta Protocol -> Protocol & Governance -> Protocol & Governance
  * -> Protocol & Governance -> ...

IDEA: "The underlying METAPROTOCOL never changes"
  * => you never or extremely rarely need to FORK that

1. Rules must be formalised
2. Processes are autonomously enforced/executed
3. Clear accountability
4. Leads to sophisticated, dynamic processes and ability to tune
  * consensus/speed of evolution

## PALLETS

**COUNCIL**
* governance primitve
* body of delegates
* chosen from a number of approval votes
* for fixed terms
* serves as body to optimise
  * and check/balance referendum system
  * powers are:
    * introduce referenda
    * cancel referenda
    * give up seat
